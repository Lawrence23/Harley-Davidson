            "label": "Harley-Davidson Inc, often abbreviated H-D or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer. From 1977 to 2014 the only motorcycles sold to the public under the Harley-Davidson brand have been heavyweight motorcycles designed for highway cruising, with engine displacements greater than 700 cc. Harley-Davidson motorcycles, or Harleys, are noted for the tradition of heavy customization that gave rise to the chopper style of motorcycle. Except for the modern VRSC and Street model families, current Harley-Davidson motorcycles reflect the styles of classic Harley designs."
